I wanted to make a blogpost about my new start page, however as I keep iterating on it, it kept changing. So every time I was working on a draft, it was quickly outdated.  
Still I keep trying. I'll go over the reason why I moved away from opening Logseq on the journal pages. The basic idea of the start page and how I keep changing things.  
Of course I will go over some of the queries I use and how to implement something similar yourself.

The previous blogposts have been building to this post. I've outlined my basic use of Logseq, but now it is time for queries.  
The biggest thing I ran into with the journal pages was that there was just too much on them. And a lot of this information isn't necessarily something I want to see all the time. On top of that there is information in pages other than my journal that I do want to see more easily.

This is how I got to my start page. One place to show what I need to see from whichever place. Therefore my start page consists solely of queries.  
In my very first blogpost I mentioned that I require a good overview. That's what my start page is suppose to help with. And that's what I've been constantly adjusting and improving.

At first my start page was incredibly long and had many different things on it. Not just things for today, but also for this week, this month, this year. And even though I mostly just used the top of the page, the rest was there, ready to overwhelm me.
