Welcome to my first attempt at a blog post! Also I thought it would be a good idea to jump in and make a series of it right away. I hope you can get some value out of my ramblings.

This first post I want to tell a little bit about myself and explore how I got to using Logseq.

I'm Siferiax and I'm a female from the Netherlands. (I really don't vibe with the word woman, the same goes for the equivalent in my native language ðŸ˜‚)

At my core I'm a data nerd. Which means whenever I can make a spreadsheet of something, I will.  
So naturally, I track(ed) a lot of data about myself as well. The place I track things, has changed a lot over the years. Google spreadsheets, Bullet Journaling, Goodnotes and various other apps, I've tried a lot. What I was looking for was an integrated system that could fill all my needs.  
I had even gone so far as to consider writing my own Android app for this purpose, but that never really got off the ground.

The different areas I want to combine are my events, my tasks, my habits, my statistics and my thoughts and ideas. The whole spectrum of my life you could say.

Bullet Journaling is probably the best at combining all the things, after all it is a paper notebook shaped to whatever you need it to be. And I really like the practice and ideas behind the method as well. What I didn't like was setting up my journal pages to capture all the information I wanted to capture.

Goodnotes allowed templates, which helped, but other limitations popped up as well. Getting my data back out of these systems, as well as creating some sort of overview.

As someone on the Autism spectrum, I am highly detail oriented and most easily lose sight of the big picture. Therefore an overview is extremely important for me!

Near the end of 2022 I found [an article on the official Bullet Journal website](https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/bulletjournalist/how-i-use-digital-sidekicks-to-aid-my-bujojitsu) that talked about digital tools for enhancing your Bullet Journal practice. The author was using Roam, but mentioned Logseq as a free alternative they were transferring over to.

I was curious, looked up Logseq, fell head over heels in love and here we are!  
What drew me in were the flat files and simple interface. The queries were what convinced me Logseq was the tool for me. They define my workflow to help me create structure and an overview every day.

In this series I want to further explore how I've implemented Logseq in my day to day life, what my workflow is like and of course what are all these queries I'm using!

So look forward to posts about...
- Implementing Bullet Journal concepts, and how I plan my day
- How I went from starting on the journal pages to using a start page
- How I implemented [the P.A.R.A. Method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) from Building a Second Brain.
- How I manage my tasks
