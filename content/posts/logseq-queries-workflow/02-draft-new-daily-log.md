One of my biggest joys in Logseq are the queries. By this time they are deeply integrated in how I operate. In the [previous post](../bullet-journaling-in-logseq) I showed how my daily was set up. I also mentioned I simplified it.

As I have learned more tricky queries, I have been able to simplify a lot of my workflow.  
I no longer use a month property to set the month, I will just get it straight from the journal's day. I no longer move my planning around, instead I utilize my start page to show it while it isn't on my journal page at all.  
A start page, because journal pages are no longer my entry to Logseq as they are by default.

First a quick run down of what my daily log looks like now
