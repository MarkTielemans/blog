So I have been musing on the best way to set up a workflow for my thoughts.
I've taken inspiration from many places.
Considered Zettelkasten, Digital Gardens, P.A.R.A, and not actually named ideas.
They all failed me in one way or the other. However, they do all contain *elements* I like.
- I like that Zettelkasten is about forming unique ideas and separating main notes (zettels) from literature notes (references). Whereby zettels are your own ideas and words.
- I like the growth analogy of Digital Gardens and using ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ³ icons to indicate the maturity of a post.
- I like P.A.R.A's simple and effective organisation.
Then I stumbled upon Wild at hearts' Zettelkasten workflow and I really liked the idea of it.
The main drawback of Zettelkasten for me is two fold I think. The "unique" and "atomic" idea writing and the idea of making an individual page for all of that.
What I like about Wild at hearts' workflow is that they start from the journal page for everything. Though their zettels also get their own page.
Having some, but not too many notes now myself, I have been able to experiment with set ups, without a lot of extra work to rearrange things.
In total there are 42 notes I have to content with.

My old set up I labeled those 42 items in a certain way, but I kept bumping up against not being really clear on what my labels represented. And also the labels not really capturing what i did put under them either.
I wanted the idea of fleeting notes and literature notes and permanent notes, however I got their definitions from different places where they meant differing things.

The humble fleeting note. I first decided, based on my understanding, that this was my ideas. Thoughts I hadn't actually processed further.
I still like this idea. The notion that "everything is a fleeting note", doesn't quite work well for me. The note that states "today I played World of Warcraft" isn't really a thought that needs further processing. That's just what I did that day.
Wild at Heart makes this distinction as well. Using a template for those fleeting notes to be processed more in the future.

I've copied much of their workflow on a process level. The exact property names differ, but they are very similar. However my definitions and how I actually use the system are different.

I completely drop the notion of atomic notes, or zettels. These don't work for me. I can't capture my thinking in one neat little snippet.
I'm more the type to expand and refine my fleeting notes.
As I've been working on a fleeting note titled "Logseq chaos", I got a better sense of what I was actually doing.
This note I was working through a problem. I felt I was bumping up against an issue and the first thing I did was brainstorm the issue. What actually is bothering me that I experience this chaos.
Then as I was doing this, solutions and ideas came up. They got added to the note.
As I was working through this brainstorm slowly conclusions emerged.
Finally the note is now title "Logseq structure" and has two headings "problem description" and "solution direction". Which have a clearly defined problem and a hypothesis for a solution to this problem.

Not something to turn into a zettel really. At least not in my opinion.
Other note types included ideas, but they had many components that fit together.
I just don't like the idea of needing 10 different zettels to express one idea. 

Finally I landed on the term best suited for what I was actually doing: exploring. I am exploring my thoughts as I write them down.
I just never get to neatly defined thoughts to put in a zettelkasten.
I'm not ~~a writer anyway~~ that kind of writer anyway.
