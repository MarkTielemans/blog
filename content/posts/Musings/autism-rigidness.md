My mind has a tendency toward extreme rigidness. But to go there, some sort of rigid structure needs to be imposed upon it. Either by myself, or by the outside world.  
This extreme rigidity will cause stress and anxiety.

So what do I mean? Take my work for example. Me and my employer have agreed on how many hours I make each week. I decided how to divide these hours across the week and how late I start and end each day. Informing my commute to work.  
This is now rigid, this is now the way things *have* to be.  
So I get stressed about missing the exact train of choice, or it being delayed or whatever.  
The flip side is, that if none of that is a factor, my work habits would be all over the place or not even get done at all.

Some structure is definitely necessary. Today is Tuesday and today this specific laundry task happens. When does it happen? Preferably in the morning, but who knows! (It's in the machine right now and it is still morning lol)  
Often plannings are made on time. This leans into rigidity. This makes it stiff and stressful.  
My planning is now made on "order", this happens first, then this, then that.  
And being kind to myself when something doesn't work out or happen.

This means I get to be stressed only about work and not everything. That's good!
